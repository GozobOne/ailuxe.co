## Appendix: ROI Calculation Methodology

### **Assumptions:**
- **Average hourly rate:** $50 (based on Kuwait event coordinator salaries)
- **Weekly hours on messaging:** 30 hours (industry average for agencies with 20+ monthly bookings)
- **Booking conversion improvement:** 15% (based on instant response vs. 4-12 hour delay)
- **Average booking value:** $500 (conservative estimate for model/event bookings)
- **Monthly bookings:** 20 (small to mid-size agency)

### **Conservative Scenario (Low ROI):**
- Time savings: 20 hours/week × $30/hour = $2,400/month
- Revenue recovery: 10% improvement = $1,000/month
- **Total:** $3,400/month benefit
- **ROI:** 11x

### **Aggressive Scenario (High ROI):**
- Time savings: 40 hours/week × $75/hour = $12,000/month
- Revenue recovery: 20% improvement = $2,000/month
- **Total:** $14,000/month benefit
- **ROI:** 47x

**Recommended Claim:** Use the **25x ROI** (middle scenario) in marketing to maintain credibility while showcasing strong value.
